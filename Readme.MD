Welcome to MathSpring.

Many IntelliJ files have been submitted, and this code is easiest to work with in IntelliJ.

---INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS---

1. Fork the repository on Github, and clone the forked repository under your user.
    ADMINS: Clone the repository on your local machine.
   - Git Bash
   - cd to dir where you want it
   - git clone git@github.com:marshall62/mathspring.git

2. Send @marshall62 or @jwnewman your public key.
   - create the public key using Git GUI from windows or ssh-keygen on Unix/Mac.  Email the id_rsa.pub file to the above.

3. At the top level, run 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update.' This will clone the content onto your machine.

4. You will need to install Tomcat and configure IntelliJ to find its installation directory.
