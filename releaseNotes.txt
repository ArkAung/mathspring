Notes:
To make sure production is updated with master branch
1.  commit and push master
2.  checkout the local production branch from IDEA lower right
3.  merge the local master branch
4.  run it to make sure it works.  Fix as necessary
5.  commit and push to production

Goal:  Make sure that production branch represents the code in the ms release and that master branch
represents the woj release.   I think I can then fix bugs in each and merge one branch into the other.


Releases:
10/27/16:   Fixed bugs related to login interventions not behaving well with missing config.xml.
Also added long answers to surveys.

 Released WOJ and MS systems.
 Pushed both Repos (master and production) so that woj=master and production=ms
